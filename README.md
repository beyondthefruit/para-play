# Catstronaut Saturn Mission React App

## 🧶 The Project

➡️ ➡️ [GO TO WEBSITE PROJECT]() ⬅️ ⬅️

I developed this website to practice my front end skills. I discovered recently the library React Spring and wanted to play with parallax effect.

### 👟 Steps

- Installed the React Spring package
- Tested various combination of effect
- Drafted the overall design of the website using mock data
- Fixed animation issues
- Mapped through data to display our crew members
